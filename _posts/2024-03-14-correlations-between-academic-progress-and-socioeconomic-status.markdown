Assume a student is a machine whose purpose is to gather knowledge about the world with the goal to give a valid 
description of one's own knowledge about the collective human knowledge on some proposed topic.

Gathering knowledge may encompass processes like:
- Downloading information into one's brain
- Learning about the plethora of techniques available to arrive at an answer of a posed question ("Ansatz")
- Training (i.e., specializing) in one or several of those techniques 
- Training the brain to interconnect the assumptions of a posed question (the "givens") with one's own knowledge (prior information) (using e.g. an Ansatz)


What are other factors relevant for the output maximization of this machine? Of the top of my head, I propose:

1. Excellent Learning techniques (How does inner, neurophysiological workings of the brain work and how can we use that knowledge to maximize our ability to gather knowledge?)
2. Good socioeconomic status

In this article, I would like to elaborate on the impact of one's and their parent's socioeconomic status on "academic 
potential", _quantitatively_.

<div style="border-left: 5px solid blue; padding-left: 25px; margin:25px 0 25px 25px">
<b>Definition: "Academic Potential" and "Academic Output Power" </b>:
Assume it would be possible to have a quantitative measure of how impactful the existence of a person on their 
academic environment is and that measure is good in the sense that it allows a relatively bias-free comparison of the
output power of two academic candidates due to their personal aptitude. Call this measure \( \mu \).

Example: Let \(A\) and \(B\) be twins and biologists. Let \(A\) be naturally more energetic, passionate and 
goal-oriented in their subject and subsequently perform better:

$$
\mu(A)> \mu(B).
$$

In the opposite direction: If \( \mu(A)> \mu(B) \), there is a high probability, maybe between \( 68\%-95\% \), that 
the seen difference in \( \mu \) is due to internal, personal eigendifferences in how science is approached by 
\(A\) and \(B\). 

Some factors that could go into constructing such a \( \mu \), i.e. measuring academic performance are:

<ul>
<li> Grades</li>
<li> Number of research projects and quality of results (as set by the mean of the peers opinion on the quality)  </li>
<li> Number and quality of publications (as set by the mean of the peers opinion on the quality), </li>
<li> Degree to which one's way of thinking establish themselves in a (sub-)field</li>
</ul>

<b>if and only if the compared people have a common background.</b>
Why that is important:

Let the academic potential of an academic candidate, or "background", \( \Phi \), be the collection of initial values (starting 
points) and all boundary conditions (constraints) on all frontiers of life at the time of 
the start of the studies, that are relevant for the studies.

Let \(\mathcal{S}\) be the learning process or actual "study" of some field as set by a university programme. 
The academic potential after the study \(S \) has been aplied for \( t \) amount of time shall be equivalent to the
academic output power value at that time: 

$$
(\mathcal{S\Phi})(t)=\mu (t).
$$

</div>

Therefore, any qualitative comparison between two academic candidates \\( A \\) and \\(B \\) regarding their power output,
must also consider their respective backgrounds \\( \Phi_A \\), \\( \Phi_B \\) <b> IF </b> (and this is important) the
goal of the comparison is to conclude whether \\( A \\) or \\(B \\) has higher internal motivation, works more precisely,
works more efficiently, etc.

If your goal is to compare two candidates with the goal of determining which of them, at the present time, has had e.g., 
better grades, as a measure of future academic potential, the current values of \\( \mu_A, \mu_B \\) will do just fine.

But if your true goal is to extrapolate the future potential of two candidates, basing your conclusion on the present
values of \\(\mu_A, \mu_B \\) without regarding their backgrounds \\( \Phi_A \), \( \Phi_B \\) that drive the evolution 
of the output power, is meaningless; An infinite number of extrapolations are possible and the conclusions need to be
weighed with the obstacles overcome (positive), motivation (positive), degree of over-worked-ness (negative), 
unused total study-time (negative) etc. to arrive at a more refined conclusion.

All of these factors could be encoded in \\(\Phi \\). 

It is my opinion that for science it is important to gather different peoples, from different cultures, 
different identities and languages that result in different thought processes and viewing angles of the same problem.

It is then through the overlap of a collection of different viewpoints where robust and sustainable science can be 
found.

Points that I think restrict my academic potential and I think are attributable to my parent's socioeconomic status
follow: 

- Having to support myself without help over the course of my four year bachelor's programme
- Having to support my parents during and beyond covid financially and as a work force
- Having to therefore work a lot
- Drastically reduced study time 
- Drastically reduced quality of study since the evil cycle of "I had to work and missed some lectures, I'll just revise them next week" begins that inevitably leads to you effectively starting to study a month before the exam, which in a lot of cases, and especially for physics, just does not cut it
- Having to work long hours and study long hours to make up for the study time lost \\(\Rightarrow \\) No study-life-balance \\(\Rightarrow \\) quality of study suffers further  
- No study-life-balance \\(\Rightarrow \\) quality of life (i.e. you!) suffers 

Now follow some numbers and statistics :)
