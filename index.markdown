<blockquote>Pursuing knowledge about the stars since 2006.</blockquote>

Hello you! Thank you for visiting my landing page. On this website you will find 
blog posts, software, videos and any other media I find worthy of sharing that documents
my journey through physics academia. 

Since as long as I can remember I am fascinated by nature. I was officially hooked 
after having read the book "Das GroÃŸe Antwortbuch der Astronomie" ("The Great Q&A on Astronomy")
which was in approximately 2006.

My goal is to contribute to the scientific knowledge of humanity in the fields of astrophysics,
data-science and cosmology, which is an incredibly exciting adventure to embark on in 
this day and age of the 21st century.

I want to excite kids and young adults to be curious about nature and the process of science 
which we use to probe nature with. In the best case I can nudge them on 
a path to consider becoming students of the natural sciences, especially physics and mathematics. 

Furthermore, when I grow up, I want to educate the next generation of excellent physicists.
